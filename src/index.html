        <h1>Creating components with Stencil</h1>
      </header>

      <p>
        Stencil is a compiler for web components. It allows developers to create
        custom elements for their website while also allowing the use of common
        developer tools such as JSX and TypeScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stencil provides a great command-line tool to get started. Build out a
        project by running <code>npm init stencil</code> on the command line and
        following the on-screen prompts to create a custom element.
      </p>

      <p>
        This stamps out a development environment and an example element that we
        can update as needed.
      </p>

import { Component, Prop, h } from '@stencil/core';
import { format } from '../../utils/utils';

@Component({
  tag: 'my-component',
  styleUrl: 'my-component.css',
  shadow: true
})
export class MyComponent {
  /**
    * The first name
    */
  @Prop() first: string;

  /**
    * The middle name
    */
  @Prop() middle: string;

  /**
    * The last name
    */
  @Prop() last: string;

  private getText(): string {
    return format(this.first, this.middle, this.last);
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Hello, World! I'm {this.getText()}</div>;
  }
}      
      </code-highlighter>

      <p>
        The <code>@Component</code> decorator denotes this class as a component.
        It requires a tag name (in this case <code>my-component</code>) but can
        take many more configuration options.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each prop is denoted by the <code>@Prop</code> decorator. These are
        values that can be changed externally through the component's
        attributes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>render()</code> method describes what the component should
        display. This is written in JSX and can contain anything required -
        HTML, JS or even other Stencil components.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each component can have some styles associated with it. These are
        applied to the component based on the path suppplied to the
        <code>styleUrl</code> property in the component set up.
      </p>

      <code-highlighter
        filename="src/components/my-component.css"
        language="css"
      >
:root {
font-size: 18px;
font-weight: bold;
text-align: center;
}
      </code-highlighter>

      <p>
        The styles applied here are scoped only to that component. This means
        they can be as generic as possible without having to worry about the
        contents spilling out and affecting the rest of the page.
      </p>

      <p>
        When built, Stencil generates a file that can be dropped in to any
        project and use the component without having to worry about its inner
        workings. This includes other Stencil projects, regular HTML pages and
        also other JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue and Angular.
